abstract: 'Moral values as commonsense norms shape our
everyday individual and community behavior.
The possibility to extract moral attitude rapidly
from natural language is an appealing perspec-
tive that would enable a deeper understanding
of social interaction dynamics and the individ-
ual cognitive and behavioral dimension. In this
work we focus on detecting moral content from
natural language and we test our methods on
a corpus of tweets previously labeled as con-
taining moral values or violations, according
to Moral Foundation Theory. We develop and
compare two different approaches: (i) a frame-
based symbolic value detector based on knowl-
edge graphs and (ii) a zero-shot machine learn-
ing model fine-tuned on a task of Natural Lan-
guage Inference (NLI) and a task of emotion
detection. Our approaches achieve consider-
able performances without the need for prior
training.'

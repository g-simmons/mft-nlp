# Site details
- Development for the site is managed via [GitHub](https://github.com/g-simmons/mft-nlp/). 
  - Issues and new features are tracked via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/g-simmons/mft-nlp/issues).
- If you are not familiar with git and GitHub, don't worry :)
  - Many contributions can be made by creating a GitHub Issue, which is as easy as a post on a forum-style website. Learn more here
  - If you're not comfortable with that and still want to contribute, email the maintainers at info@mft-nlp.com for help.
- To add content to the site data, or the site itself, you can create a pull request if you are familiar with GitHub
- The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.
- Jekyll supports a mix of markdown and html content.
- Pages for tasks, datasets, foundations, methods, and papers are auto-generated from the site data JSON files. 
- The site data is stored in the [data](https://github.com/g-simmons/mft-nlp/data) folder.

# Contributing to the site data (task, datasets, papers, methods, foundations)
